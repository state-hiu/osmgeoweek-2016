Missing Maps is celebrating it’s one year anniversary this month. To date over 3,500 volunteers have attended map-a-thons (a mapping party) in one of 11 countries, collectively making 12 million map edits and putting 7.5 million people on the map. We can easily make a difference in another corner of the world from the comfort of our own home, school or workplace.  Join thousands of volunteers around the globe and leave your own mark on the map November 15th at the University Village Microsoft Store in Seattle, WA. Drop in anytime with your laptop between 12PM and 5PM to map for as long as you want. Red Cross volunteers will be on hand to get you started and show you how to map. In exchange for your participation, we’ll treat you with refreshments and swag!
