In celebration of GIS Day and National Open Street Map Geo Week, San Francisco State's Institute for Geographic Information Science (IGISc) will host a Missing Maps event. Our goal is to help map vulnerable places in the lesser developed world so that local and international NGOs, communities, and individuals can use the maps and the data to better respond to crises affecting these areas.
