In the frame of Geography Awareness Week 2015, the Geomatics team of the Department of Civil, Chemical, Environmental, and Materials Engineering (DICAM) at University of Bologna is hosting this Mapathon for students and the larger community. The event is free, but you need to bring a laptop (a mouse is suggested). You can create an account at www.openstreetmap.org before the event. No mapping experience is necessary.
