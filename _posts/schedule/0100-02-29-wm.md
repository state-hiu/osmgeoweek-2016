Join us in our effort to provide data for the Afghanistan earthquake relief teams in our [OpenStreetMap Mapathon!](http://www.wm.edu/as/cga/GIS_Day_Folder/index.php) This is meant to be a fun, social event, but for a good cause. Refreshments will be served, including pizza, and no previous GIS experience is required.

Location: Center for Geospatial Analysis, 2nd floor Swem Library
Time: 6pm - 10pm
