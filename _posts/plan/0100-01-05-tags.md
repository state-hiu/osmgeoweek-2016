While you’re editing, it is important to tag each feature so that they are readily identifiable within OSM. This guide explains tags for food related features.

‘Tagging’ refers to the practice of assigning attributes to the map features you just digitized. Tags consist of two parts: key and value. The key is a general level classifier, such as ‘highway’. The value is a more specific classification, such as ‘secondary’. E.g. ‘highway’ = ‘secondary’. 

In the iD editor, feature tagging is done through the pane on the left side of your screen. These general tags might apply to almost any item: 

* name = (the feature's name)
* addr = (the feature's address, if known)
* website = (the URL of the feature's website, if applicable)
* opening_hours = (the hours the feature is open to the public, if applicable)
* description = (any descriptive information about the feature)
* note = (anything that provides more context about the feature and perhaps, data quality)

## Food Tagging

<table>
<tr><th>Type</th><th>Key</th><th>Value</tr></th>
{% for feature in page.features %}
<tr><td><em>{{feature.description}}</em></td><td>{{feature.key}}</td><td><ul><li>{{feature.values | join: '</li><li>' }}</li></ul></td></tr>
{% endfor %}
</table>
