Western Nepal faces a significant threat of earthquakes and natural disasters. However, geospatial data is largely inaccessible or non-existent. In the wake of a major disaster, first responders and those involved in recovery efforts will be handicapped by this lack of information. Help us map Pokhara to make available data vital to disaster planning and response.

[Secondary Cities](http://secondarycities.state.gov/) is the United States Office of the Geographer’s flagship field-based initiative to assist rapidly growing cities to build capacity for data generation for resiliency, human security, and emergency preparedness.

Pokhara is Nepal’s second largest city after Kathmandu - the 2011 national census recorded a population of around 255,000. Rapid and unplanned urbanization has resulted in a population now exceeding 300,000. The city is located near the base of the Himalayas, where the residents are subject to earthquakes and flooding events from the Seti Gandaki River. Help us to map critical infrastructure in Pokhara.  Using current high-resolution imagery, we will digitize roads, buildings and other major features within the city. OpenStreetMap will be used as the platform to digitize and store data for usage by first responders, planners and geospatial enthusiasts.


##Project will be posted soon
