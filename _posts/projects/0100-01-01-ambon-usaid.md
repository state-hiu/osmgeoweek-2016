While integral for community resilience, detailed information on critical infrastructure is often times missing. Data of this nature is critical for communities, the private sector and governments to integrate climate change adaptation and DRR into their planning processes.

As part of an ongoing effort to fill the gaps, we will focus on OpenStreetMap data creation in Ambon City, Indonesia. This mapping effort is in direct support of the USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) funded *Adaptasi Perubahan Iklim dan Ketangguhan (APIK)* program. The APIK program emphasizes building capacity to prepare for, manage, and respond to disaster events at both the national and community levels. 

Ambon City is the capital and main seaport of Ambon Island, with a population of 330,335 (as of 2010). The city is home to many natural hazards including continual flooding, landslides, storm risk, and regular earthquakes. In 2012, torrential rains resulted in flooding and landslides that severely damaged 397 houses and three bridges. 10 residents were killed with over 4,000 left displaced. It is estimated that with recent climate change, the coastal areas of the island will be more susceptible to flooding at increased regularity.
