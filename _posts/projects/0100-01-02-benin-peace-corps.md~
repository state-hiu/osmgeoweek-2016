According to the World Health Organization, children under 5 are one of the most vulnerable groups affected by malaria. Of the estimated 584,000 malaria deaths in 2013, approximately 78% were children under 5 years of age. Children who contract malaria progress more rapidly towards death than adults and are more susceptible to severe anaemia, hypoglycemia and cerebral malaria.

The Peace Corps public health program in Benin is working to provide improved geographic data for Beninois health professionals in Peonga to closely monitor, test and treat malaria in children under 5. The Peonga-based health professionals will also use the geographic data generated through this project to display malaria trends in the area. 

# How to Contribute

[Please join us](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1117) in providing a base map of Peonga to the health professionals and Peace Corps public health program in Benin. We need help remotely digitizing satellite imagery of roads and buildings; once complete, the field team will use the [OpenStreetMap platform](http://openstreetmap.org/) and [Field Papers](http://fieldpapers.org/) to verify the remote mapping and add detailed local knowledge.
