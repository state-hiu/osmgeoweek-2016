This project directly support programs under the U.S. [President’s Malaria Initiative](www.PMI.gov), which was launched in 2005 with the goal to reduce malaria-related mortality by 50 percent across sub-Saharan Africa.

As the lead foreign assistance agency for the US Government, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), along with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), are working together to implement the 2015 - 2020 President’s Malaria Initiative Strategy. The new strategy takes into account the progress over the past decade and new challenges that have arisen. Malaria prevention and control remains a major U.S. foreign assistance objective and PMI's Strategy fully aligns with the U.S. Government's vision of ending preventable child and maternal deaths and ending extreme poverty. Under the PMI Strategy for 2015-2020, the U.S. Government's goal is to work with PMI-supported countries and partners to further reduce malaria deaths and substantially decrease malaria morbidity, towards the long-term goal of elimination.

Data created from this mapping effort will help indoor residual spraying programs in Mozambique stop the spread of malaria. It is intended to help indoor residual spray teams, who apply insecticide to the walls of houses to kill mosquitoes which transmit malaria, with project scope and enumeration planning. These updated maps will make smart choices on exactly where to spray, and improve spray team activities by providing enumerators with maps to help carry out their campaign.
